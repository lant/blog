<p> After some years of working as a developer I've realized the lack of standard guidelines when it comes to writing technical documentation. Not user manuals. Technical documentation, the one you <i>should</i> write when you develop a system, or the one you <i>should</i> get when you start maintaining a system somebody developed. </p><p>   So, no standard guidelines around ? (at least that i liked), no problem, open source, open world. I made my own.  </p><p> I started researching, getting technical documentations from different projects, getting the opinions from lots of good professional developers and using lots of common sense (<b>my</b> common sense, well, and sometimes other people's common sense) and this is what i came to:</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ok, I tried, I promise, I tried. I cannot format the document in Blogspot. I've created a static html page. You can find the article: <a href="http://users.last.fm/%7Emarc/doc/">HERE</a></span><br /></p>
