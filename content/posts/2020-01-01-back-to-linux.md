Intro -> I started being a hardcore linux user around 2000
uni -> lots of Linux

Start to work as a dev -> ubuntu

Apple fever -> Mac/Linux/Mac

Some things still have not changed much for me. 
* Pain to configure the laptop 
* Systemd
* Battery 

Nice things
* Unity + Ubuntu pretty much works. 
* Audio
