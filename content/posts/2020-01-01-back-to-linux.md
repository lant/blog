I recently went back to Linux after 6 years of using basically Apple computers. 

My computer chronology is basically this one: 

## High School
Nineties! Windows 95/98. Word, Doom II, Warcraft 2 and IRC. Basically. 

## Uni years, hi Tux!
I discovered Linux and I loved the idea, I decided that the only way to learn how to use Linux was to get in deep shit, so this is what I did. I poked around a little bit and somebody got a [Slackware]() CD, I deleted Windows and that was it. I had a computer with Linux, no idea on how to use it and lots of work to do at University. 

It was extremely fun, I had plenty of time to mess around, read man pages, compile and recompile kernels, look for package dependencies, patch programs. I learnt a big lot. 

## First job, being busy. 
Uni was over, so I got a proper job and went to live with my girlfriend. So, no more messing with the computer. This basically means that it had to be a reliable machine to work with. The easiest way was to put an Ubuntu in there, default settings, tweak a small bit and start to work. 

## London 
Went to work to London. People there were using Macbooks, tons of them. So I gave it a shot and got one. 

From there I started using Linux less and less, to the point where my computers at my different jobs were always macs, the same as in home. 

Until 1 year ago. When I started at my current job I got a Macbook Pro. 

Back to Linux

Why? 
* i3 
Some things still have not changed much for me. 
* Pain to configure the laptop 
* Systemd
* Battery 

Nice things
* Unity + Ubuntu pretty much works. 
* Audio
